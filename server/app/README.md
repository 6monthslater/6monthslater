# Remix App

This folder contains the main Remix server code.

Since Remix is a Server-Side-Rendering (SSR) framework, code is used by both the client and the server.

All code is shared by the client and server unless `.server.` is present in the filename, in which case it is server-only.

Any code in each file that is not used clientside is automatically excluded by Webpack.

## Folders

- `components` contains React components for the frontend UI and has its [own documentation](./components/README.md).
- `lib` contains generated utility functions for [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). We did not write the code in that folder.
- `queue-handling` contains the code that handles communications with the Scraper services through RabbitMQ.
- `routes` contains code for each of the UI page routes visitable by users. Because each file in that folder
  is treated as a route, a README cannot exist in that folder (Remix would try to compile it as a route and crash).
- `types` contains shared TypeScript types, interfaces and objects shared by the app.
- `utils` contains shared TypeScript utility functions shared by the app.

## Files

- `root.tsx` is the root of the entire Remix webapp.
- `entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx` are generated by Remix and are used to launch the app clientside and serverside, respectively.
